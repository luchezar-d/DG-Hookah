# Netlify redirects for React Router (SPA)
# This ensures all routes are handled by React Router instead of trying to find static files

# Redirect all routes to index.html with 200 status (SPA fallback)
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Redirect common API routes or specific paths if needed
# /api/*  https://your-api-domain.com/:splat  200
